# KazTranslit
transliteration software used to convert Cyrillic to Latin letters.

contact me on instagram @_runley

## how this works
there are 2 main features of this application, being real time and document transliteration

### Document transliteration
you input a document and press 'go' to get the equivalent document but in the newer Latin alphabet

### Real time trasnliteration
you can type and you will get text generated in real time (or apear to be in real time) after you type up all you need you can copy paste it where ever you need.
